    	<p>Here you can edit a phone number record.</p>
    	<p>The description field is optional. If it is filled in, a Smart Poster record is created, if not a URI record is created.</p>
    	<p>The format of the URI that is used is <i>tel:&lt;phonenumber&gt;</i></p>
    	<p>Depending on whether you are editing or creating a record, there will be different buttons visible:</p>
    	<ul>
	    	<li>Next - start writing</li>
	    	<li>Save - finish editing</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p>You can use special values in your fields that will be replaced during writing. The following
    	values are supported:
    	<ul>
    		<li>%ctr1% - The first counter. The value starts at 0 and is increased every time this counter is used. To reset the counter, go to the preferences screen.</li>

    		<li>%ctr3% - The third counter.</li>
