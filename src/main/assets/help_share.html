		<h3>Share</h3>
    	
    	<img src="screenshots/share.png" />
    	
    	<p>In the Share screen you can select the content that will be shared with other NFC devices
    	when they are put close to your own device. The receiving device must support receiving of
    	NFC items from other phones as opposed to from a physical NFC item.</p>
    	
    	<p>Click the button to go to the history/create screen that allows you to create new content
    	to share, or select previously written or backed up content. After selecting the new content,
    	the application will return to this screen.</p>
    	
    	<p>When the checkbox "Enable sharing" is clicked, the application starts sharing the content.
    	In the Standard Edition and up, this is not only active in the current screen, but most of the
    	time while TagWriter is in the foreground. An exception to this is the preferences screen, and
    	when selecting new content to share. In the Lite Edition sharing is only active on the Share
    	page.</p>
    	
    	<p>The sharing status is indicated with the blinking icon in the title bar: If it is blinking
    	sharing is enabled; if it not visible, sharing is disabled.</p>
    	
    	<p>A long-click on the content box will show options for that particular content:</p>
    	
    	<ul>
    		<li><b>Backup</b>: Create a backup of this item. Since this item already exists it will be moved to the top of the history list.</li>
    		<li><b>Launch</b>: Depending on the item type, the 'launch' action will act on the item. For example,
    		an SMS will be opened in the SMS editor, a phonecall with the dialler etc. When the user has specified
    		that an item can be directly launched in the preferences, the SMS will be sent straight away, the phone call
    		will be made straight away, etc.</li>
    		<li><b>Store as bookmark</b>: Only visible for URLs: the content can be stored as a bookmark.</li>
    		<li><b>Store in contacts</b>: Only visible for Contacts: the content can be stored as an entry in your Contact list.</li>
    	</ul>
    	
    	<p>Not all options are available for all content types.</p>
